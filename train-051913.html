Columns of various orders, pilasters and bow fronts characterise the square and its flanking terraces, all of which enjoy sea views and access to extensive lawns. </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 >  </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Carlton Hill </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > 4.05 acres (1.64 ha) </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > 2008 </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > This early-19th-century working-class area was comprehensively redeveloped in the mid-20th century after degenerating into a slum, but a few old buildings remain: Tilbury Place is a good example of Georgian architecture, George Cheesman junior's severely Classical church dates from 1839, and the cobble-fronted Mighell Farmhouse survived when adjacent buildings were demolished for Amex House, a large office block. </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 >  </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Cliftonville, Hove </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > 40.05 acres (16.21 ha) </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > 1969 </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > A small area of "delightful mid-Victorian houses", in a villa style with angled bay windows and exterior ironwork, this 1850s suburb is an example of the long-lasting influence of the Regency style on Victorian domestic architecture. </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 >  </td></tr>

The area has well-spaced Italianate houses in a more modestly detailed style than the rest of Cliftonville, with prominent architraves, quoins and eaves, yellow brickwork and mosaic tiled paths. </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 >  </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > East Cliff </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > 153.99 acres (62.32 ha) </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > 1973 </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Hundreds of listed buildings, a strong and little changed street pattern and the prevalence of Regency architecture characterise the East Cliff, which developed from the late 18th century because of its proximity to the fashionable Old Steine. </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 >  </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Engineerium, West Blatchington </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > 8.89 acres (3.60 ha) </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > 1982 </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Built in 1866 as the Goldstone Pumping Station to provide more piped water for Brighton and Hove's rapidly growing population, this became a museum in 1976. </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 >  </td></tr>

<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Hove Station </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > 14.56 acres (5.89 ha) </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > 1996 </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Built as Cliftonville in 1865, Hove railway station soon stimulated middle-class residential development. Goldstone Villas, a wide tree-lined avenue with terraced houses in various styles, was developed in the 1880s and 1890s. </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 >  </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Kemp Town </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > 47.94 acres (19.40 ha) </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > 1970 </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > The estate has two sea-facing terraces (Arundel and Chichester Terrace) linked to a three-sided square (Sussex Square) by Lewes Crescent, an 840-foot (260 m) double curve of 28 stuccoed houses with large Corinthian pilasters at regular intervals. </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 >  </td></tr>

<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > North Laine </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > 41.37 acres (16.74 ha) </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > 1977 </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Based around the east end of Church Street, the oldest road, this tightly packed residential and commercial area was developed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, helped by Brighton railway station's proximity. </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 >  </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Old Hove </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > 34.44 acres (13.94 ha) </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > 1997 </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Hove Street—the ancient village street, whose manor house was demolished in the 1930s—and its surroundings make up this conservation area.

<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Patcham </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > 20.78 acres (8.41 ha) </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > 1970 </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > This ancient downland village was extensively suburbanised in the interwar period, but the core of the village—around All Saints Church—remains intact. </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 >  </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Pembroke & Princes, Hove </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > 54.74 acres (22.15 ha) </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > 1989 </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Most of this area consists of large late Victorian and early Edwardian houses built during Hove's westward expansion. There is also some later housing, mainly of the 1920s and 1930s. </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 >  </td></tr>
