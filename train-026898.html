<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > - </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > G clef (Treble clef) The centre of the spiral assigns the second line from the bottom to the pitch G above middle C. </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > - </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > C clef (Alto, and Tenor clefs) These clefs point to the line representing middle C. As illustrated here, it makes the center line on the staff middle C, and is referred to as the "alto clef". </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > - </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > F clef (Bass clef) The line between the dots in this clef denotes F below middle C. Positioned here, it makes the second line from the top of the staff F below middle C, and is called a "bass clef". </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > - </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Neutral clef Used for pitchless instruments, such as some of those used for percussion. Each line can represent a specific percussion instrument within a set, such as in a drum set. </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > - </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Octave clef Treble and bass clefs can also be modified by octave numbers. An eight or fifteen above a clef raises the intended pitch range by one or two octaves respectively. </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > - </td><td class="highlighted"  colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Tablature For stringed instruments it is possible to notate tablature in place of ordinary notes. In this case, a TAB sign is often written instead of a clef. </td></tr>
