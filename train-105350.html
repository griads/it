</table> <br> <h3>Sentence(s)</h3>1. The Ceramic capacitor offers a temperature range from −55 °C to +125 °C with a capacitance change of ±15% at most. <br> <br><br><b>Categories:</b><br><b>Numerical:</b> Uses math skills for writing the sentence. Uses math operations (addition, subtraction, average, etc.), counting numbers, frequency of items, etc.<br> <b>Commonsense:</b> Uses commonsene knowledge about situations humans encounter in everyday life – physical objects, word meanings, social or physical domains, peoples' intentions, etc.<br> <b>Temporal:</b> When concepts related to time and temporal aspects are required for writing the sentence. Duration, ordering, typical time of events, time differences between events.<br> <b>Table:</b> Writing the sentence requires knowledge from the table except: the highlighted cells, row and column headers, table titles, section titles, section texts.<br> <b>Out of Table:</b> Writing the sentence requires external knowledge that is not present in the table nor common sense. Knowledge about some specific domain comes under this category. </body></html>
