It was conceived to support small numbers of units performing mainly an Anti-Air Warfare (AAW) role on a single network. <br> <table>
<tr> <th colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Link 11 </th><th colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Link 22 </th></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Roll Call Transmission allocation. Increased net cycle times due to increasing numbers of Participating Units (PUs) and tracks. </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Uses TDMA which provides deterministic access to the network. Prioritization of messages ensures most important are transmitted before less important </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > No way to transmit urgent information </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > The use of Priority Injection timeslots in the TDMA structure can be used to minimize the delay in the transmission of urgent information </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Limited number of participants (62) </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > More units (125) </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > A restrictive "playing area" based on the ranges of individual platforms, and more importantly, on its method of reporting its position, and that of its tracks, based on its distance from a Data Link Reference Point (DLRP). </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Uses the Worldwide Geodetic System (WGS-84), same as Link 16, so no limitation. Each NILE unit can operate simultaneously on up to four networks; a Super Network can be composed of up to 8 networks. </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > All units have to be in RF connectivity with the Net Control Station, again limits the area of operation </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > The use of routing & relay protocols greatly increases the playing area, even when using line-of-sight UHF. </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Relatively easy to spoof because of weaknesses in the security of the system </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > More difficult to spoof, and any attempts to spoof are easier to detect, due to features such as time based encryption </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Relatively easy to jam a single HF or UHF fixed frequency network </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > A single HF or UHF fixed frequency network can still be jammed, however with multiple networks it is more difficult to jam all at the same time. </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > The encryption level is not sufficient for the processing power of modern computers </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Uses same crypto chip as Link 16. Crypto technology is being updated to meet future requirements </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > The loss of the Net Control Station will cause the network to collapse </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Does not use a Net Control Station. Designed with no single point of failure </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > The accuracy of Link 11's M-Series messages is inadequate for modern targeting </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Data items are designed with improved ranges and granularity using same data dictionary as Link 16 </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Available waveforms limit communications under bad RF conditions (as occur in polar regions) </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > A variety of more robust waveforms. In bad conditions strong coding can be used to maintain communication at the expense of throughput </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > M-Series messages difficult to translate making data forwarding between links complex </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Link 22 is part of the J-Series family of messages, uses the same data dictionary as Link 16 and so makes translation and forwarding relatively easy compared to Link 11 </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Limited Bandwidth (1,800 bit/s for fast and 1,090 bit/s for slow) </td><td class="highlighted"  colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Range of bandwidths available depending on coding and media for example fixed frequency: HF 1,493 – 4,053 bit/s UHF 12,666 bit/s </td></tr>
</table> <br> <h3>Sentence(s)</h3>1. For Link 22, the UHF fixed frequency data transfer rate is 12,666 bit/s. <br> <br><br><b>Categories:</b><br><b>Numerical:</b> Uses math skills for writing the sentence. Uses math operations (addition, subtraction, average, etc.), counting numbers, frequency of items, etc.<br> <b>Commonsense:</b> Uses commonsene knowledge about situations humans encounter in everyday life – physical objects, word meanings, social or physical domains, peoples' intentions, etc.<br> <b>Temporal:</b> When concepts related to time and temporal aspects are required for writing the sentence. Duration, ordering, typical time of events, time differences between events.<br> <b>Table:</b> Writing the sentence requires knowledge from the table except: the highlighted cells, row and column headers, table titles, section titles, section texts.<br> <b>Out of Table:</b> Writing the sentence requires external knowledge that is not present in the table nor common sense. Knowledge about some specific domain comes under this category. </body></html>
