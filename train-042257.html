<tr> <th colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Menu option </th><th colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Effect </th></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Alternate and BootCrack </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > This option would load a workaround for booting games. It only worked on certain types of game images. </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Load Boot Crack Routine </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > An advanced option that allowed uploading of program code for the use of boot related problems. </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Backup Card Auto → DRAM </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > This option would read a game cartridge and store it in the V64's RAM. </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Backup Card Auto → PC </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Same as the previous option, but would transfer the data to a PC through the V64's parallel port. </td></tr>

<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Upload V64 BIOS to PC </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Another advanced option for DV64 developers. It would transfer Doctor V64's own program code to the PC through a parallel connection. </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > DX256 Upload to PC </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > This command allowed operation of specific features of the DX256 cartridge adapter (an alternate cartridge adapter sold by Bung). </td></tr>
