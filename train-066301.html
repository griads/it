Mid-20th century biology texts about invading species reflected more complacency than alarm, as contemporary wisdom about them assumed the host environment would be largely immune. <br> <table>

<tr> <td colspan=3 rowspan=1 > Melaleuca tree seeds were scattered by aircraft in order to drain flooded portions of the Everglades. They were considered excellent landscaping trees as late as 1970 and planted along canals to stabilize soil or act as windbreaks. </td></tr>

<tr> <td colspan=3 rowspan=1 > The Old World climbing fern has taken over tree islands in the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge in the northern Everglades, completely blanketing some of them, and crowding smaller vegetation by shading native seedlings and overwhelming trees. </td></tr>

<tr> <td colspan=3 rowspan=1 > Brazilian pepper was marketed as a southern alternative to holly. Birds and small mammals have spread its seeds by eating the red berries and expelling them from their digestive tracts, allowing the plants to establish in very remote areas that are difficult to reach and hamper control efforts. </td></tr>

<tr> <td colspan=3 rowspan=1 > Three species of tree are considered collectively to be Australian pines. They were planted as windbreaks along canals and agricultural fields, and as shade trees in the middle of the 20th century. </td></tr>

<tr> <td colspan=3 rowspan=1 > Latherleaf grows in dense mats that crowd and shade native vegetation, threatening several endangered plants. It has successfully spread to every protected area in the Florida Keys, and is well entrenched in remote areas of Everglades National Park where it threatens coastal hardwood forests and mangrove islands. </td></tr>

<tr> <td colspan=3 rowspan=1 > Water hyacinths are free floating and have been a particular problem in northern Florida waterways, but since they began to grow in the Everglades, their rapid reproduction (they can double their population every 6 to 18 days and will increase the coverage of surface water by 25% a month if gone unchecked) has impeded the controlled release of water by blocking canals and water control devices. </td></tr>

<tr> <td colspan=3 rowspan=1 > Water lettuce is similar to water hyacinths in that it is also free-floating, reproduces rapidly, blocks canals and water control devices, and can form mats that block sunlight and oxygen to plants and animals under water. </td></tr>
<tr> <th colspan=4 rowspan=1 >  </th></tr>

<tr> <td colspan=3 rowspan=1 > Burma reed is a grass with large, dry plume-like flowerets that invades the pine rockland ecosystem—one of the most endangered habitats in the state—feeding fires. </td></tr>
<tr> <th colspan=4 rowspan=1 >  </th></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=2 > Hydrilla verticillata Flat shallow body of water with an airboat in the background and two people standing on it holding plants they apparently pulled from the water, which in the foreground is full of plants with long strands and short even pinnate formations </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Hydrilla, water thyme, Florida elodea, waterweed </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Sri Lanka / 1950s </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Possibly spread from aquariums, found on every continent except Antarctica </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=3 rowspan=1 > Like the other water plants, hydrilla reproduces rapidly. Although it is not free floating, it grows quickly to the water surface, and if it breaks apart it can form new plants from fragments. </td></tr>
<tr> <th colspan=4 rowspan=1 >  </th></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=2 > Dioscorea bulbifera Tree trunk covered by a vine with large deltoid-shaped leaves </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Air potato, potato yam, air yam </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Asia: introduced during slave trade / In Florida by 1905 </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Escaped from USDA test gardens, landscaping </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=3 rowspan=1 > The air potato is an aggressively growing vine that exhibits tubers on the outside rather than underground, which can promote its rapid growth when they fall to the ground. </td></tr>
<tr> <th colspan=4 rowspan=1 >  </th></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=2 > Cupaniopsis anacardioides Short tree with full bushy leaves of indiscriminate shape </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Carrotwood, Beach Tamarind, Green-leaved Tamarind, tuckeroo tree </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Australia / 1960s </td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1 > Landscaping </td></tr>
<tr> <td colspan=3 rowspan=1 > Carrotwood grows easily in many South Florida habitats, including coastal dunes, beaches, marshes, pine rocklands, hammocks, mangrove forests, and cypress swamps. </td></tr>

<tr> <td colspan=3 rowspan=1 > Downy rose myrtle was recently added to priority invasive species lists for its tendency to overtake pine rockland ecosystems. Typically pine rocklands consist of slash pines towering over saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) understory shrubs and small herbs. </td></tr>
