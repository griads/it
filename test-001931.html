<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 >  </td><td colspan=4 rowspan=1 > The participants were all "gentlemen" though "others" could attend as spectators.

<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 >  </td><td colspan=4 rowspan=1 > The primary source gives the venue as "Maulden" which almost certainly refers to Town Malling.

<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 >  </td><td colspan=4 rowspan=1 > Probably a minor local match only but it illustrates the popularity of cricket in Kent. The original source is the diary of one Thomas Minter, a Canterbury resident, who wrote: "We beat Ash Street at Crickets (sic)". </td></tr>

<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 >  </td><td colspan=4 rowspan=1 > This match is the earliest known mention of White Conduit Fields as a venue.

<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 >  </td><td colspan=4 rowspan=1 > The continuation of the September 1718 match (see above entry), which was abandoned by the Rochester players.

<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 >  </td><td colspan=4 rowspan=1 > Reportedly played for "a considerable sum of money". There is an insight into the priorities of early 18th century cricketers as the contemporary report concludes with: "The Kentish men won the wager" (i.e., the wager was more important than the match). </td></tr>

<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 >  </td><td colspan=4 rowspan=1 > Two London fielders were seriously injured by a clash of heads when chasing the ball. Waghorn speculated that their injuries may have caused a perception that the sport is "dangerous" as the next report he could find was for a match in 1726. </td></tr>

<tr> <td colspan=1 rowspan=1 >  </td><td colspan=4 rowspan=1 > The subject of a letter in The Weekly Journal dated 21 July 1722. It is believed the match took place somewhere in the Islington area, so the exact venue may have been White Conduit Fields. </td></tr>
